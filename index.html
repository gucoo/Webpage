	Hi, I am <strong>Guanwen Chou</strong>. My major is <em>computer science</em> at <ins>North Carolina State University</ins>. 
	I am studying computer science at NCSU,because I like doing CS and enjoy learning it.
	It is applied almost everywhere in our live and it has great potential to improve our future as well.

	<p>
	I  work at an <strong>accounting Company</strong> in Cary NC, which is quite different from computer science.
	Because accounting work is less challenging to me,so I change my studying field to <ins>computer science</ins> years ago.
	I am luckily to get the scholarship at NCSU for 3 years.  
	After I graduate from NC State I want to pursue the graduated degree.
	My <em>dream</em> job is to do something that I can have much fun , feel meaningful , with good income and less pressure, 
	so that I could have energy to contribute myself in our community and benefit the world, which I think it will be the true meaning of our life.
	It is kind of abstract but I have read a book of CS Alibaba Entrepreneur,he also has this kind of same insight.
